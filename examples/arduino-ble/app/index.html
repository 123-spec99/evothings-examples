	<h1>Arduino BLE</h1>

	<button id="on" onclick="app.on();" class="green">LED ON</button>
	<button id="off" onclick="app.off();" class="red">LED OFF</button>

	<h2>Variable resistor value</h2>

	<h2>Info</h2>

	<p>This app shows how to connect to an Arduino BLE shield. Note that you must run this app in the Evothings client app, or build a Cordova app with the plugin com.evothings.ble. Device with support for Bluetooth 4.0 and Android 4.3 or higher required.</p>
	
	<h2>Example circuit</h2>

	<p><img src="arduino-ble-board-sketch.png" style="max-height:30%;" /></p>

	<h2>How it works</h2>

	<p>The ON &amp; OFF buttons controls digital pin 2 on the Arduino which is here connected to an LED. The plot shows the input from analog pin A0 which is here connected to a variable resistor (potentiometer). Please experiment with your own circuits and let us know how cool they are!</p>
	
	<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

	<p>There are known problems with that BLE stops working when switching between apps or doing multiple reloads. In this case restart the Evothings client app. Additionally, you can use the Evothings Workbench Tools to see any error messages that may help in your investigation.</p>
