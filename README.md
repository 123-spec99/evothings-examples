# Examples for Evothings Studio

Apps in folder 'generated/examples' are included in the [Evothings Studio download](http://evothings.com/dowload).

Apps in folder 'generated/experiments' are under development and are not guaranteed to work.

Example app source files are in folders 'examples' and 'experiments'. Note that these cannot be run as is. If you wish to run the examples in Evothings Viewer or build a stand-alone Cordova app, use the code in folder 'generated'.

JavaScript libraries and CSS files shared across apps are in folder 'resources'.

The Ruby script 'build.rb' copies relevant files from 'resources' to 'generated'.

<!-- To remove files copied by 'build.rb', run 'git clean -fdX'. -->
